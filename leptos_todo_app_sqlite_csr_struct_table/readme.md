# leptos_todo_app_sqlite_csr_struct_table

This is Leptos' `todo_app_sqlite_csr` example, updated to use `leptos-struct-table`.

This example shows:

-   how to combine client-side rendering with server functions, i.e., using server functions as a convenient way to create an ad hoc API, but without using server-side rendering and hydration.
-   how to use `leptos-struct-table` to create a table component from a struct.
-   how to use sqlite database on the back-end to persist the data.

## Run

Use `cargo leptos watch` to run the example.
