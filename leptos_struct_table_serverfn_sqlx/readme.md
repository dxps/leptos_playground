### leptos_struct_table_serverfn_sql

This is a sample that showcases:

-   how to use a table (using on [`leptos-struct-table`](https://github.com/Synphonyte/leptos-struct-table))
-   using leptos server functions
-   and using a sqlite based data source through `sqlx`.

It is mainly based on [serverfn_sqlx](https://github.com/Synphonyte/leptos-struct-table/tree/master/examples/serverfn_sqlx) example, just adapted a bit: fixed the sqlite file, and populate it with some data.

To run the example execute `cargo leptos watch`.

If you don't have `cargo-leptos` installed, execute `cargo install cargo-leptos` to install it.
